# TODO LIST

A simple todo list app made for study purposes, using React Native, React Redux, Redux Persist, Expo, and much more.

## Getting Started

Clone the repository to your local machine then run this command:

```
yarn add flat
```

or

```
npm install
```

this will install all of the required dependencies of the project. After that, just run

```
expo start
```

and play with it in your local Android device! 

Cheers!
